# üß† AI Study Planner (Frontend Prototype)

## ‚ú® Overview

This repository hosts the **frontend structure and user interface** for an AI-powered study planner application.

The application allows users to input their syllabus details (via text or image upload) and simulates the generation of a customized, topic-wise study schedule.

## üöÄ How to Use (Local Setup)

Since this is a single-file prototype, no installation or build steps are required.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the file:**
    Navigate to the project folder and simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note (Limitations)

This is a **frontend-only demo**.

* The **"Generate Study Plan"** button uses **mock data** and a simulated delay to demonstrate the final output.
* The **"Upload Syllabus Image"** input and **"Download as PDF"** button are **placeholders** and require a backend server and API integration (e.g., using Python/Node.js with Gemini/GPT APIs and a PDF generation library) to function in a real-world scenario.

## üìÑ Code Structure

* `index.html`: Contains all the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity in one file.
