Abstract
This document describes a single-file web application that serves as a frontend prototype for an AI Study Planner. Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the application provides a user interface for inputting academic requirementsâ€”either via typed text or an uploaded syllabus image. It simulates the process of generating a customized, topic-wise study schedule by displaying mock data after a short delay, demonstrating the intended user flow and presentation of the final plan. The prototype includes styling for responsive design and placeholder functionality for a backend service (e.g., PDF download and AI integration).

Introduction
The primary goal of this code is to create a realistic, standalone user interface (UI) for a hypothetical "AI Study Planner." The application is designed to address the common challenge students face in organizing complex academic material into manageable study schedules. While the core logic of processing a syllabus and generating a plan requires a backend AI service (like Gemini, GPT, etc.), this prototype successfully delivers the visual structure and client-side interactivity to validate the frontend experience. The code is written entirely in one file, prioritizing simplicity and ease of demonstration.

Description and Overview
The code is a well-structured HTML file that encapsulates all three core web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for interactivity.

1. HTML Structure
The structure is divided into three main sections:

<header>: Contains the title and a brief description of the tool.

<main class="container">: Uses a flex layout to hold the two primary columns:

.input-section: Where the user provides data. It contains an input area (<textarea>) for text-based syllabus details and a file input (<input type="file">) for image-based syllabus uploads. It features the Generate Study Plan button.

.output-section: Where the generated plan is displayed in the #plan-output div and features the Download as PDF button.

<footer>: Contains copyright and prototype information.

2. CSS Styling
The embedded <style> block ensures a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface:

Aesthetics: Uses a light green color scheme (#4CAF50) to suggest progress and efficiency.

Layout: Employs a two-column layout using CSS Flexbox for larger screens (.container) and switches to a single-column layout for mobile devices (@media (max-width: 768px)), ensuring full responsiveness.

Detailing: Includes transition effects on buttons (:hover, :active) and focus styles on input fields to provide good visual feedback. Special styling is applied to the generated plan's table for readability.

3. JavaScript Interactivity
The <script> block manages the client-side logic:

generatePlan(): This is the core function.

It validates that the user has provided at least some input (text or image).

It updates the output area with a "Processing..." loading message and disables the Download button.

It contains a MOCK DATA block with an await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)) call to simulate a 3-second network/AI processing delay.

After the delay, it populates the #plan-output with the sample HTML study schedule (including a styled table) and enables the Download button.

downloadPDF(): This function serves as a placeholder. It alerts the user that a backend service would be required to properly format and generate a PDF, demonstrating that the functionality is intended but not implemented on the frontend.
